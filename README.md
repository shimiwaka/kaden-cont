# Overview

This script controlls [RS-WFIREX4](https://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B07MVC7394/) by PC.

If the binary of the packet are saved in advance by packet capture, they can be reproduced with this script.

The IP addresses of the source and post-transmission terminals are also required.

I created this around 2020 so it is pretty poor code.

# Usage

`./sendtcp.py light_on.bin`
